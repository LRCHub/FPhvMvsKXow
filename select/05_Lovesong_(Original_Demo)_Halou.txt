When this is done
And all dissected
You still won't know
The power that you have
And when i've gone
My own direction
You still won't know
What slipped through you hands

Now i hang from the floor
Im not sure who i am

All is love
Open to it
All is trust
It's waiting for us

And though my eyes
Do not reflect it
So much impact you have had
And though you have
Grown to expect it
I won't be here
For you to understand
