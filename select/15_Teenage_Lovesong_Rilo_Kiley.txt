We were teenagers the first time we met
You were so famous, I couldn't resist
I was your girl then, that's what you said
When you kissed me, kissed me, kissed me

I gave you sweet love, boy, you said it was nice
It was my first time, we did it just twice
Went out for some sodas, when will you return?
But you dissed me, dissed me, dissed me

I went away for reasons disclosed
You broke my heart man, oh you didn't know
But now I'm back to see you again
Did you miss me? miss me? miss me?

We were teenagers the first time we met
You were so famous, I couldn't resist
I was your girl then, that's what you said
When you kissed me, kissed me, kissed me

Oh Davey, why did you leave me
All alone when we went all the way?
But maybe someday Davey
We'll be together for more than a day

I still love you and always will
All those motel rooms, you fronted the bill
I am not bitter, I want you to know
Got yours comin', I've seen it before

So now we're standin' so damn close
You've been in rehab, you think I don't know
I just remind you of yesterday
Places forgotten and friends passed away
But if you want me please won't you say
So I can dis you, dis you, dis you, dis you, dis you
And go away
