Every love song I'll sing for you
Tell tonight is here for us
On the dance-floors the night is so high
We dance together under the sun
Come on and take my hand
They says the night don't wait
I'll show you my best moves
And we will be as one
And we will always be together

The night has loved before
The night is all we get
I'll make my best tonight
To be the one for you
The night has loved before
The night is all we get
I'll make my best tonight
To be the one for you
